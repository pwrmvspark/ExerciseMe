To do:

1. refactor date to start and end date
    - add another calendar for end date
    - make more interactive/dynamic 

2. use logins for "admin" view and "member" view
    - admins will have access to creating work outs, registering users, deleting/editing workouts

    - member access will be limited to viewing their own work outs
      - create functionality to mark work out as "completed" / "attempted" / "did not work out"
      - can edit but must be approved by admin

3. list members in members component
    - add functionality to delete members who dont utilize trainable.io anymore
    - add functionality to edit member info 

4. make homepage for app
    - add functionality to click *trainable.io* to load homepage 
    - add summary/purpose/plan


5. make more resposive ( edit | delete ) buttons on workout list page
